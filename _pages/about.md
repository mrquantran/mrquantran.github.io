👋 Hello! I’m `Quan Tran Hong`. Thanks for stopping by my learning journey!

📚 This space is where I track my experiences, share insights, and reflect on my growth.

🚀 As a former `full-stack developer`, I’ve taken an exciting leap into the world of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Currently pursuing a Master’s degree, I’m transitioning toward a `research-focused` career and actively seeking opportunities to dive into a **PhD program**.

💡 My passion lies in `Machine Learning Perception`, where I’m captivated by **Computer Vision**, **3D Reconstruction**, **Deep Learning**, and **Generative Models**. I’m driven by the question: *How can cutting-edge technologies create meaningful, real-world impacts in life and engineering sciences?*

🌟 In my sparse time, you’ll find me *running* 🏃‍♂️, *traveling* 🌍, *photography* 📸, or *enjoying quality time* with friends and family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.

🔍 If you’re an employer or professor looking for a driven, curious, and research-oriented candidate, I'd love to connect! I’m excited to discuss how we can collaborate on innovative projects or groundbreaking research.
