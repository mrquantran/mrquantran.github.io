Hello! I'm Quan Tran Hong, a passionate individual with a strong background in technology and a growing enthusiasm for research. With over two years of experience as a full-stack developer, I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence as a transition toward a research-focused career, and I am seeking opportunities in a PhD program.

Having moved from software engineering to the world of research, I am deeply fascinated by Machine Learning Perception, particularly in areas like Computer Vision, 3D Reconstruction, Deep Learning, and Generative Models. I am eager to explore how these technologies can create meaningful impacts in life and engineering sciences.

In my spare time, I enjoy running, traveling, and spending quality time with friends and family.
