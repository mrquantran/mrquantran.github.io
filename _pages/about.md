👋 Hello! I’m `Quan`. Thank you for visiting my learning journey!

📚 I share my experiences, insights, and reflections on my growth on this space.

🚀 As a former `Software Engineer`, I’ve taken an exciting leap into the world of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Currently pursuing a Master’s degree, I’m transitioning toward a `research-focused` career while actively seeking opportunities to enter a **PhD program**.

💡 My interest research on Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, 3D Reconstruction, Deep Learning, and Generative Models.

🌟 In my sparse time, you’ll find me *running* 🏃‍♂️, *traveling* 🌍, *photography* 📸, playing musical instruments [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/@PianoPlayersTTG/videos) 🎸🎹.
