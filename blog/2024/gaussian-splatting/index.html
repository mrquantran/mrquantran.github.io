As with other volumetric techniques, <strong>floaters</strong> appear in regions closer to the camera, manifesting as randomly scattered Gaussians.</p> <p>To address this, a strategy is employed where the <strong>alpha values are reset to 0 every 3000 iterations</strong>. During the stage where $M$, $S$, $C$, and $A$ are optimized, the alpha values transition from 0 to non-zero values over <strong>100 iterations</strong>. After these 100 iterations, the unwanted values are removed through the <strong>Remove Gaussian</strong> operation during the <strong>Gaussian densification</strong> phase.</p> <p>Another benefit of this approach is that it also addresses cases where 3D Gaussians overlap.

While anisotropic Gaussians offer many advantages, they can sometimes result in elongated artifacts or blotchy Gaussians. (This phenomenon has also been observed in other studies.) When creating large Gaussians through optimization, artifacts occasionally appear, primarily in areas that exhibit different appearances depending on the viewing pose.</p> <ul> <li>One reason for these artifacts is the trivial rejection of Gaussians during the rasterizer stage through a guard band. Using a more theoretical culling approach could mitigate these artifacts.</li> <li>Another reason lies in the simple visibility algorithm, which can lead to abrupt switching in depth/blending order of Gaussians. This issue could potentially be addressed with anti-aliasing, which has been left as a topic for future research.</li> </ul> <p>The algorithm proposed in this paper currently cannot incorporate any form of regularization. Introducing regularization could help better handle unseen areas and regions prone to artifacts.</p> <p>Although the same hyperparameters are used across all evaluations, initial experiments suggest that reducing the position learning rate might be necessary for convergence in very large scenes (e.g., urban datasets).</p> <p>Compared to prior point-based approaches, this method is highly compact, but it still uses significantly more memory than NeRF-based solutions. Training large scenes can cause peak GPU memory usage to exceed 20 GB. However, implementing low-level optimization logic could substantially reduce this. Rendering a trained scene requires sufficient GPU memory to store the entire model, with additional memory demands for the rasterizer ranging from 30 to 5000 MB depending on the scene size and image resolution.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/no-pose-no-problem/">Simple 3D Gaussian Splats from Unposed Images</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Quan Hong Tran. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>
