The problem is further compounded when rendering unbounded scenes at 1080p resolution, where no existing method can achieve real-time display rates.</p> <p>This paper has become a hot topic in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">novel-view synthesis field</code>.

As with other volumetric techniques, <strong>floaters</strong> appear in regions closer to the camera, manifesting as randomly scattered Gaussians.</p> <p>To address this, a strategy is employed where the <strong>alpha values are reset to 0 every 3000 iterations</strong>. During the stage where $M$, $S$, $C$, and $A$ are optimized, the alpha values transition from 0 to non-zero values over <strong>100 iterations</strong>. After these 100 iterations, the unwanted values are removed through the <strong>Remove Gaussian</strong> operation during the <strong>Gaussian densification</strong> phase.</p> <p>Another benefit of this approach is that it also addresses cases where 3D Gaussians overlap. By periodically resetting the alpha values to 0, instances of large Gaussians overlapping are effectively eliminated.</p> <p>The strategy of periodically resetting alpha values to 0 plays a significant role in controlling the overall number of Gaussians.</p> <h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1> <p>Mip-NeRF360 utilized <strong>4 A100 GPUs</strong>, whereas the others used <strong>A6000 GPUs</strong>. FPS refers to the rendering speed.

When creating a cube three times the size of the input camera’s bounding box and sampling it uniformly, it was found that the method performed relatively well without completely failing, even in the absence of SfM points. As shown in the figure below, performance degradation is mainly observed in the background.</p> <p>In areas not covered by the training views, initializing with random values results in floaters that cannot be eliminated through optimization. From another perspective, synthetic NeRF datasets do not exhibit this issue because they lack backgrounds, and the input camera pose values are well-defined.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/paper-notes/gaussian_splatting/ablation_sfm-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/paper-notes/gaussian_splatting/ablation_sfm-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/paper-notes/gaussian_splatting/ablation_sfm-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/paper-notes/gaussian_splatting/ablation_sfm.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="densification">Densification</h2> <p>They evaluated the densification method from the perspectives of cloning and splitting.

While anisotropic Gaussians offer many advantages, they can sometimes result in elongated artifacts or blotchy Gaussians. (This phenomenon has also been observed in other studies.) When creating large Gaussians through optimization, artifacts occasionally appear, primarily in areas that exhibit different appearances depending on the viewing pose.</p> <ul> <li>One reason for these artifacts is the trivial rejection of Gaussians during the rasterizer stage through a guard band. Using a more theoretical culling approach could mitigate these artifacts.</li> <li>Another reason lies in the simple visibility algorithm, which can lead to abrupt switching in depth/blending order of Gaussians. This issue could potentially be addressed with anti-aliasing, which has been left as a topic for future research.</li> </ul> <p>The algorithm proposed in this paper currently cannot incorporate any form of regularization. Introducing regularization could help better handle unseen areas and regions prone to artifacts.</p> <p>Although the same hyperparameters are used across all evaluations, initial experiments suggest that reducing the position learning rate might be necessary for convergence in very large scenes (e.g., urban datasets).</p> <p>Compared to prior point-based approaches, this method is highly compact, but it still uses significantly more memory than NeRF-based solutions. Training large scenes can cause peak GPU memory usage to exceed 20 GB. However, implementing low-level optimization logic could substantially reduce this. Rendering a trained scene requires sufficient GPU memory to store the entire model, with additional memory demands for the rasterizer ranging from 30 to 5000 MB depending on the scene size and image resolution.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="paper-notes"/><category term="gaussian-splatting"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The paper begins by highlighting the recent revolution in novel-view synthesis using Neural Radiance Field methods, which renders 3D scenes from various viewpoints, given multiple images and their corresponding camera pose values]]></summary></entry></feed>
